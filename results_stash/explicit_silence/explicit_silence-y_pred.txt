not a sound if you value your lives thank you
to offer resistance would have been madness for even hermon perceived by the loud clanking of weapons around them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prison near the place of execution
was he to be led to the executioner's block to be continued
what pleasure had life to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art
ought he not to greet his sudden end as a boon from the immortals you
did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be imagined you
whatever might await him he desired no better fate
if he had passed into annihilation he hermon wished to follow him thither and annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery you
but if he were destined to meet his myrtiless and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not to tell them how sure he was of finding a joyful reception there from both you
the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was not nemesis no it was a kindly deity you
it was no illusion that deceived him
again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers you
sometimes with touching entreaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philippus her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
cried harriman in grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and followed the soldier whom the captain detailed to guide her into the palace you
tomorrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path you
daphne charred with a grave exclamation the order of the king you
as soon as the captive artist was alone with the woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forth incoherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly return the pressure he could not restrain the desire to clasp her to his heart
in spite of his deep mental distress he could have shouted aloud in his delight and gratitude you
he might now have been permitted to bind forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the paluster the following morning still sealed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought not to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impulse he exclaimed you know that i love you you
i love you and have loved you always
what more is needed
but hermon with drooping head murmured tomorrow i shall no longer be what i am now
then daphne raised her face to his asking so the demeter is the work of myrtillas you
what a terrible ordeal again awaits you
an eye fool blinded also in mind could be vexed with you for it
bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it if you consent when the time arrives to become mine conceal and palliate nothing you
the city on one of his own ships that very day
he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city you
his heart contracted painfully and his solicitude about his uncle's fate increased when philippus informed him that the conspirators had been arrested at the banquet headed by amyntas the rhodian chrysippus and proclos had perished by the executioner's sword at sunrise
besides he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one last word
on the way his heart throbbed almost to bursting
even daphne's image and what threatened her father and her with him receded far into the background
he was appearing before his companions only to give truth its just due to the one fairly demonstrated in abu yazidi's practice
the egyptian obeyed and his master crossed the wide space strewn with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the feast of performances even had his eyes retained the power of sight his blood was coursing so wildly through his veins that he might perhaps have been unable to distinguish the statues around him and the thousands of spectators who crowded closely together richly garlanded their cheeks glowing with enthusiasm surrounded the arena hermon son
shouted his friend satylus in joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk you
even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeter he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithless to his art and his nature
honour to myrtilus and his art but he trusted this noble feast of assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception and aid his prayer for recovery you
when he came from the bath proclus visited him again
but hermon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honor of the seventieth birthday of the old sculptor
she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour you
so the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition
the banquet was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing daphne and telling her the words of the oracle i am the lord of the heavens i am the lord of the earth i am the lord of the heavens i am the lord of the heavens
he longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her soul
since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescue demeter might yet be the work of myrtillus had again mastered him you
the approval as well as the doubts which had arised in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the fact that
then he went directly to the neighboring palace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting you
hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered it impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy
when hermon entered the residence of the grammatius in the palace the guests had already assembled the the the the to the the he the the the the he i think i will you go them that is most serious
the place by hermon's side which althea had chosen for herself would then be given up to arsinoe you
true an interesting conversation still had power to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon him upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight and referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyment his blindness debarred him as were numbers saddlebradm
a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and women to whom no tie bound him save the presence of the same host a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and women to whom no tie bound him save the presence of the same host a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and women to whom no tie bound him save the presence of the same host
crates had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair harrod nyko had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing arsenals praises among his professional associates
his son had been the royal dame's first husband and she had deserted him to marry lysimachus the aged king of thrace you
the king's sister the object of his love cried harman incredulously
we women are only as old as we look and the leeches and tyrant women of this beauty of the world you
the three most trustworthy ones are here amytas the leech chrysippus and the admirable leech chrysippus
let us hope that you will make this threeleaved clover the luckpromising fourleaved one thank you
your uncle too has often with praiseworthy generosity helped arsinoe in many an embarrassment you
how long he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the whole city with delight you
when he did finally summon you
that is going too far replied hermon you
he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arsinoe had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in rhodes
the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and althea eagerly confirmed the statement you
her mom listened to the pair in silence the end
the rodion was just beginning to praise arsinoe also as a special friend and connoisseur of the sculpture's art when kraites hermann's fellow student asked the blind artist in behalf of his beautiful companion why his demeter was placed upon a pedestal which to others as well as himself seemed too high for the size of the statue
yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of scorn at him
a woman who yearns for the regard of all men and makes love a toy easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals
only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and althea did not wish to lose hermon's regard you
how indifferent you look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you was still a genuine creating artist the case was different it
though so loud a denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no idle delusion ensnars me i can prove you
it was nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
whither hath my lonesomeness gone spake he spake he
my shadow calleth me

but doth's artustra need to be frightened by his shadow thanks for watching

what has happened to me
he asked himself something warm and living quickeneth me it must be in thy neighborhood
when however zlatoustra was quite nigh unto them then did he hear plainly that human voice speak in the midst of the kine and apparently all of them had turned their heads towards the speaker you
what do i here seek
answered he the same that thou seekest thou mischiefmaker that is to say happiness upon earth
for i tell thee that i have already talked half a morning unto them and just now were they about to give me their answer to

once upon a time a brahmin who was walking along the road came upon an iron cage in which a great tiger had been shut up by the villagers who caught him
the brahmin answered no i will not for if i let you out of the cage you will eat me
oh father of mercy answered the tiger in truth that i will not you
i will never be so ungrateful only let me out that i may drink some water and return
then the brahmin took pity on him and opened the cage door but no sooner had it turned so that the tiger jumping out said now i will eat you first and drink the water afterwards
so the brahmin and the tiger walked on till they came to an abandoned tree and the brahmin said to it abandoned tree abandoned tree hear and give judgment
on what must i give judgment asked the banyan tree you
this tiger said the brahmin begged me to let him out of his cage to drink a little water and he promised not to hurt me if i did so but now that i have left him out he wishes to eat me
it's just that he should do so or no you
let the tiger eat the man for men are an ungrateful race
sir camel sir camel cried the brahmin hear and give judgment subtitles by the amaraorg community
at a little distance they found a bullock lying by the roadside the bullock was lying by the roadside
is it fair that he should do so or not
let the tiger eat the man for men have no pity
three out of the six had given judgment against the brahman but still he did not lose all hope and didn't mind to ask the other three
on what must i give judgment asked the eagle he replied
the brahman suited the case and the eagle answered whenever men see me they try to shoot me they climb the rocks and steal away my little ones
then the tiger began to roar and said judgment of all is against you o brahmin straight out of the roof the first hundred and sixty thousand колв was displacement of the holy lands the sixth cozy сек servitude which was in the right was touring in the right and no need the firstanz abou was forced to leave people's houses the firstt abou abou abourabeth  butterash
after this they saw an alligator and the brahmin related the matter to him hoping for a more favorable verdict
but the alligator said whenever i put my nose out of the water men torment me and try to kill me you
the brahmin gave himself up as lost but again he prayed the tiger to have patience and let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge
now the sixth was a jackal the seventh was a jackal
the brahmin told his story and said to him uncle jackal uncle jackal say what is your favorite book

when they got there the jackal said now brahman show me exactly where you stood you

proceed on your journey friend raman you
your road lies that way and mine this thanks for watching
and as accomplished he excited the admiration of every silly quacket and the envy of every fluttering pocum but by all young gentlemen and ladies of understanding he was heartily despised as a mere civilized monkey
that his soul might afterwards occupy such a station as would be most suitable to his character it was intense to inhabit the body of that finical grinning and mischievous little mimic with four legs which you now behold before you you
chuckled the colonel as he skillfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook you
and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip the now limp fish into the creel colonel ashley gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
the reason she asked no alimony inquired kenneth what
no i wasn't thinking of that i wasn't thinking of that
however don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough for today
well i don't know that you can
it isn't generally known went on the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him
it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of a baser sort you
you don't mean that larch struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did how are you going to pay it back what have you done i haven't i just you know i'm just you run this
the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him
should be fine by when i say stanton's statement was being unexpectedly confirmed you
he remembered that cynthia and grafton had once been in love with each other 
she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer the end
because larch made no defense thanks for watching
larch by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation you
so i had to let her have her way and we did not ask the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel fee i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel fee
no but he will or i'll sue him and get judgment oh he'll pay all right
and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up subtitles by the amaraorg community
still i would like to know
the murderer of mrs darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweller was tried you
it had a double reputation so to speak
grave and even reverent the conventions assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper if not better class were frequently seen in its diningroom or caf the
larch himself was a peculiar character
in a smaller place he would have been called a saloonkeeper you
and it was this man rich it was said handsome certainly that cynthia ratchford had married you
to this was the answer whispered money thanks for watching
and in a way it was true subtitles by the amaraorg community
she also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges to be continued
after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the large hotel it could hardly be called a home became the scene of many festive occasions you
then it was said of large that soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat his wife with refined cruelty that hidden away from the public underneath his habitual manner there was the rawness of the brute
but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less often represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smirched or who had not yet acquired any and were willing to take a chance
it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me and the vicechancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be seen there kenneth explained to the colonel
meanwhile colonel ashleigh was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he saw darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something be done always returned the answer
don't worry it will come out alright thanks for watching
i'm going to rectify them but it will take time
it's hard for miss mason too although she's bearing up like a major

i said where have you been remarked the other we've missed you the end
i said i was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort
why polonius some would ask
because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
there was a rattle of coins on the mahogany bar as king sought to disentangle a single bill from the waddedup currency in his pocket the
it's an odd coin an old roman one that mrs darcy had in her private collection kept in the jewelry store safe was the whispered answer you
i went over them the other day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed you
that was hers went on the jeweler you
now harry king has it exclaimed colonel ashley
but excuse me didn't you figure on doing some detecting and giving up fishing thank you
and shag with the freedom of an old servant stood looking at his master as if not quite understanding the new twist the affairs had taken you
i'm going off fishing i may not catch anything and may not want to after i get there
get ready shag yes sir colonel
and having put himself in a fair way as he'd hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darcy case colonel ashley went down to police headquarters to learn more facts in connection with the murder of the east indian
pinkus and donovan haven't they carol o judges play pool please take your sponsors has timeframe
carroll was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke curl lazily upward from his cigar just then to say more you
are you going to work on that case colonel no i'm going to work on that case
but he hadn't any more to do with it colonel than that cat you
perhaps not admitted colonel ashley you
we've got our man and that's all we want

i'm working in the interest of the young man i'm working in the interest of the young man
it's just one of them coincidences like 
busted his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair you
gad explained the colonel gad replied the colonel
the very pair i was going to buy what was it i hadn't bought yet so i just picked the bag it learned too bad sorry i don't know not to worry you don't have to worry about the other person's experiences they can help there's one now the situation is when you show them the bands that you don't have but the band that was not signed danny
look here colonel do you know anything about this
and the detective's professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer you
i happened to see those candlesticks in the window of singafutt's shop the other day and i made up my mind to buy them when i had a chance 
now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen no rules
but i don't know whether that's his first or his last name anyhow he had a partner named shir e
anyhow he and phutt didn't get along very well it seems
neighbors often heard them scrapping a lot and this afternoon they went at it again hot and heavy
to buy a lamp you
he found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was ali's body with the head busted in and this heavy candlestick near it you
sure held so tight we could hardly get it out you
maybe the fight was about who owned the watch for the daggles talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were saying i see you
and the watch have you
that's the watch announced the headquarters detective reaching in for it going in see police police
you're not as squeamish as all that are you just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's you're not as squeamish as all that are you
i'm sorry i'm sorry and donovan's voice was plainly skeptical i'm sorry i'm sorry
yes it may have some rough edges on it it will always get this way
and i've read enough about germs to know the danger i'd advise you to be careful
if you don't mind i should like to examine this a bit
before the big wind in iran suggested thong with a nod at his irish compatriot slightly laughed the colonel you
that's right agreed the colonel as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the stillticking watch等時 pla k 트� つ。
and a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a lead pencil
and donovan take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it you
yes asked the surprised detective i spied all fish except for since i have noticed  
don't scratch yourself on it whatever you do why not why not
simply because this watch is for new people
someone out here to see you out here to see you
all right be there in a second
shingafut was the panting answer thank you
i want to talk over darcy's case with you the colonel had said and the two had talked had thought had talked again and now were silent for a time
what are the chances of getting him off legally if we go at it from a negative standpoint asked the colonel you
rather a hypothetical question colonel but i should say it might be a fiftyfifty proposition you
at best he would get off with a scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn't want that nor do i you
and you i don't want it either i don't want it either
but i want to know just where we stand now i know i know
but i need to do a little more smoking out first now i want to think
if you'll excuse me i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may catch something
in fact i have a feeling that i will land my fish i have a feeling that i will land my fish
i'd recommend him to you instead of blackstone thanks laughed kenneth you
what is it perhaps i can help you
the old adage of two heads you know the old adage of two heads you know
yes it still holds good
no alimony replied the colonel puzzled yes just that you
and there's no reason you shouldn't know thank you
so he turned to the wazir dandan and said to him verily your tale is a wonder of wonders
o chief wazir that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions for that his almighty will restoreth to you zawah makan and his sister nusat alzaman whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can
when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the twain and what befell them and the cause of their long absence
mackan bowed his head awhile and then said i accept the position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way
then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharkan więc sh load
after a while the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of baghdad and khorasan a conquering host like the pooltide sea and sharazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say
when it was the seventyeighth night they were going with somos beyond description the universay will be the easily
and in it all rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place
lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zawal makan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and sire's son's peer
moreover the sultan commanded his wazir dandan call a ten days halt of the army that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain
he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days
replied he of a truth i heard him not and i wot him not and folks are all sleeping you
but she said whomsoever thou seest awake he is the reciter thank you

what ails thee then that thou must needs recite verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
and he also improvised the two following dstitches thank you for watching
when uthod alzaman heard the first improvisation she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their willam home then she wept and cried to the eunuch and said to him woe to thee the end
he who recited the first time hath recited a second time and i heard him hard by and i heard him hard by
by allah and thou fetch him not to me i will assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee and he shall beat thee and cast thee out amen
but take these hundred dinners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt thank you

when it was the seventythird night it was the seventythird night
but the eunuch said i will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returning to my lady without him
now when the fireman heard these words he feared for zawal makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch by allah it was not i and i know him not
so go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry whether he be near or far it will be i or someone i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me
then he kissed the eunuch's head and spake him fair till he went away but the castrato fetched around and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
i say what made my ignominy whatever the bitter cup i drain far be from me thy land to flee nor will i bow to those who blame and for such love would deal me shame

we will do thee no upright o my son nor wrong thee in aught but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and return in will and safety and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news thank you for watching
then the eunuch went out to zawal makan and said to him recite what verses thou knowest for my lady is here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition
and also these
then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit the end
when the eunuch saw this case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover when the eunuch saw this case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover when the eunuch saw this case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them somewhat to cover them somewhat
after a while they came to themselves and uzzat alzaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses

but now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me
the chamberlain called the castrato and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the stalker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girding his ass and preparing for flight

well doctor decide our fate said the princess tell me everything

as you please the princess went out with a sigh i love you
the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations thank you for watching
and there are indications of malnutrition nervous excitability and so on thank you
the question stands thus in presence of indications of tuberculous process what is to be done to maintain nutrition we have attentiveness it depends which type of plant it is and how much it longs for growth of the equivalents we have such good
yes that's an understood thing responded the celebrated physician again glancing at his watch

what's that sound he asked ah it is it's a
oh well then i can do it in twenty minutes closed captioning provided by tyler at gpknives
and how about a tour abroad asked the family doctor
what is wanted is the means of improving nutrition and not for lowering
the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
but in favour of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences you
and then the mother wishes it
ah well in that case to be sure let them go only those german quacks are mischievous just me 
oh time's up already and he went to the door
the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so that he ought to see the patient once more you
oh no only a few details princess come this way princess
and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawingroom to kitty you
when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tears
she answered him and all at once got up furious you
excuse me doctor but there is really no object in this thank you
this is the third time you've asked me the same thing
the celebrated doctor did not take offense he did not take offense
nervous irritability he said to the princess when kitty had left the room however i had finished you
and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certainly harmless
at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged into deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem interestingly he had no comment at all the man said this is itself an invisible event that we know irgendwelves witnessed this is a real one what happen if the third particular october's sleepy of ships unnerves a further survey here we have one the book of john

educated people of the upper classes are trying to stifle the evergrowing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social order thank you
this is absolutely incorrect
in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the group you
the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible and that's where it happens and if we want toosten the more relevant onun we will tosten the more relevant our officers in order to understand them but that leadership whenever they enter into the service of their china they carried something bad it wasdd
the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires
the basis of authority is bodily violence thank you
the possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison in submission to one will subtitles by the amaraorg community
these bands of armed men submissive to a single will are what constitute the army
the army has always been and still is the basis of power
power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything and court popularity in the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
indeed it could not be otherwise
only under those conditions could the social organization be justified thank you
but since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power are always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
even if there was once a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage because the violence of the government was less than the violence of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strife between the individuals seems still less and the life of the state seems even more secure you
it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle and conquest
after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself you
but this justification is never more than temporary
internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the dissentient individuals you
government authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the furthest limit beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs you
the most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest you
so it has always been thank you
the fact that in america the abuses of authority exist in spite of the small number of their truths not only fails to disprove this position but positively confirms it thank you
the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer relying on pinkerton's men they feel that the security of their position depends on the increased strength of the army you
the reason to which he gave expression is essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the popes engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of today so carefully distribute the recruits so that the regiments from the frontiers are stationed in central districts and the regiments from the centre are stationed on the frontiers so that the regiments from the frontiers are stationed on the frontiers
the meaning of caprivi's speech put into plain language is that funds are needed not to resist foreign foes but to buy underofficers to be ready to act against the enslaved toiling masses you
and this abnormal order of things is maintained by the army
but there is not only one government there are other governments exploiting their subjects by violence in the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its enslaved subjects subtitles by the amaraorg community
and so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its neighbor brigands thank you
this increase is contagious as montesquieu pointed out a hundred and fifty years ago
every increase in the army of one state with the aim of selfdefense against its subjects becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies for more information visit www någonarticlescom
the despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggressiveness of a government increases with its internal despotism thank you
the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers is obtained at the least possible expense
and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practised upon them all citizens have become their own impressors you
this inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service thank you
in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitoriness of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life to groups of persons
but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they admit to avoid
but instead of doing that they exposed the individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors you
the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend you
the danger of war ever ready to break out renders all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless you
but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that subtitles by the amaraorg community
governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense but that is not true thank you for watching
they are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an accomplice in all the acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own you
and for the sake of what am i making them
i am expected for the sake of the state to make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity i am expected for the state to make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
except for the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evildisposed persons in our own country
we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number but that can only be done by a change of environment and moral influence
so that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evildisposed persons even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago has none whatever now you
except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means of communication and so on you
without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything
this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in forming societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
without governments nations would be enslaved by their neighbors
the government they tell us
and if defence against barbarous nations is meant one thousandth part of the troops now under arms would be amply sufficient for that purpose you
the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes us on the contrary to much greater danger of such attacks you
even looking at it practically weighing that is to say all the burdens laid on him by the state no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with the state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantageous than to refuse to do so
to resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not capable
so much for the advantages and disadvantages of both lines of conduct for a man of the wealthy class an oppressor you
for a man of the poorer working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages you
they went down to their quarters first
guess mr finney went to his quarters i don't remember seeing him cross the deck or come over that way at all

the captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering the situation at which something was happening
then he said well i do
this ship is more to me than wife or mother or family
he paused fingering his lower lip and looking sideways in a reflective fashion at chris standing before him you

i shall say that you
not since he had left mr wicker and chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard you

what with the one window and the lowering day outside the long narrow shop was sombre oh i was weren't up to the idea but that you'm the problem is that you know multiple cameras at once but at a
heavy handhewn beams crossed it from one side to the other
mr wicker's back being toward the source of light chris could not see his face you
the double fans of minute wrinkles breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheekbones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead
little tufts of white fuzz above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarian's hair but what drew and held chris's gaze were the old man's eyes
chris blinked and looked again yes they were still there
chris swallow his voice came back to him
yes sir he said if you do allied

he guessed there must be a lively fire in that room beyond
slow motion would that interfere with jakey getting the job sir slow motion
but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mind why had he not seen the reflection of the headlights of the cars moving up around the corner of walter street not the hill toward the traffic signals

it was no longer there nor were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen
the warehouses were still there

no electric signs no lamplit streets enough entire learnedpeople's teachers' books
where the people's drug store had stood but half an hour before rose the roofs of what was evidently an inn you
a courtyard was firstly lit by a flaring torch or two showing a swinging sign hung on a post
the post was planted at the edge of what was now a broad and muddy road thanks for watching
a coach with its top piled high with luggage stamped to a halt beside the flagged courtyard

what should i do first thank you
how you've improved my boy he exclaimed it is now time for you to try this is as good a change as any to be continued
i suppose i change and can't change back
mr worker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for chris to get up his courage
then as nothing happened with a voice like a whip mr wicker said start at once you
the sensations spread faster and faster thank you
his head swam and he felt faint and a little sick but he persisted through the final words you
he thought not without a feeling of pride and commenced experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight that some little time elapsed before mr wickers b 아무리brое

the figure's shoes carved in some eastern style had curved up pointing toes you
then all at once the idea came to chris thank you
if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
he squatted on his haunches examined the carved wooden figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion you
but how did one change inanimate to animate
chris got up and stole back to mr worker's door
he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his room above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was really empty mr james's proper shape and opened the doors of the cupboard at the far end of the room

with infinite caution chris closed the door silently behind him and running lightly forward reached the figure of the negro boy you

you think he really needs it subtitles by the amaraorg community
he would have liked to get the job for jakey who needed it but somehow the task of facing mr wicker especially now that the light was going and dusk edged into the streets was not what chris had intended for ending the afternoon
mike's expression changed at once to one of triumph but chris was only partially encouraged
bitch you aren't going after all just turn to him
mike was standing on the corner
oh shucks
chris started off once more passing a bleak little victorian church perched on the hill above mr wicker's house
an empty lot cut into by church lane gave a look of isolation to the lshaped brick building that served mr wicker's both house and place of business you
the longer wing toward the back had a back door that opened on a water street the space between the house and wisconsin avenue had been made into a neat oblong flower garden fenced off from the sidewalk by box shrugs and a white picket fence
a livid yellow stained the horizon beyond the factories and the clay clouds lowered and tumbled above you
the air was growing chill and chris decided to finish the job we were so considerably 북 oluyor like didn't realize i'd smoothly graduated finally all my friends joined in and i was paid with such little face cash i felt truly buried with shock don't like being этой i sticked in always for his companyグ hayddi grin بر goddess дạtے

at the foot of the hill he reached the house
there were three things that always caught his eye amid the litter of dusty pieces you
on the left the coil of rope in the centre the model of a sailing ship in a green glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of a negro boy in baggy trousers the model of a sailor in a white turban
but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe at home in bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabell you
he had never seen anyone go into mr wicker's shop now he thought of it you
how then did he live and what did he ever sell

they persecute the saints
they shut their eyes to the truth darkness is the rule darkness is the rule
the most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind you
oh how wicked people are
by order of the king signifies today by order of the revolution
one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead a holy death is prohibited
gauthier bishop of chalons held his own in this matter against otho duke of burgundy
the prioress took breath then turned to bed
you will close the coffin the sisters will carry it to the chapel you
the office for the dead will then be set
but she will hear she will not listen
besides what the cloister knows the world learns not
a pause ensued a pause ensued
you will remove your belt

he will pay it at four o'clock today
the appeal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been wrung to be continued
but you do not understand any of the peels thank you

ah the da exclaimed froschlavant ah the da exclaimed froschlavant
the veal stuck fast in his throat you
he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath you
i will put earth in the coffin reverend mother that will produce the effect of a corpse you
i will make that my special business
wilt thou serve me and watch my seven foes asked the king
the youth thought that it was very easy work to watch the foals and that he could do it so they were prepared a часовa and they opened it probable that the sal amigo was a forest robber so yes
hast thou watched faithfully and well the whole day long said the king when the lad came into his presence in the evening
yes that i have said the youth you
he had gone out once to seek a place he said but never would he do such a thing again you
then the king promised him the same punishment and the same reward that he had promised his his hebben  that he would need his pride and let him have his traditional
when he had run after the foals for a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by a cleft in the rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with the distaff and she called to him
come hither come hither my handsome son and let me comb your hair thank you
the youth liked the thought of this let the foals run where they chose and seated himself in the cleft of the rock by the side of the old hag you
so there he sat with his head on her lap taking his ease the livelong day
on the third day siddalad wanted to set out
the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go but all to no purpose and cinder lad set out on his way you
i am walking about in search of a place said cinder lad you
i would much rather have the princess said cinder lad you
and thus they journeyed onwards a long long way the end
when they had gone thus for a long long way the foal again asked dost thou see anything now
yes now i see something that is white said cinderella under the screen i saw
it looks like the trunk of a great thick birch tree
cinderlad tried but could not do it so he had to take a draw from the pitcher and then one more and after that still another and then he was able to wield the sword with perfect ease
for we are brothers of the princess whom thou art to have when thou canst tell the king what we eat and drink but there is a mighty troll who has cast a spell over us you
when they had travelled a long long way the foal said dost thou see anything you
and now
now then said the fool dost thou not see anything now you
that is a river said the foal and we have to cross it
i have done my best replied cinder lad you
general observations on preserves confectionery ice and dessert dishes
the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for except the sugar is used in considerable qualities the success is very uncertain subtitles by the amaraorg community
fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be mildewed and be of no service for preserves you
but to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience
if you dip the finger into the syrup and apply it to the thumb the tenacity of the syrup will on separating the finger and thumb afford a thread which shortly breaks this is the little thread
let it boil up again then take it off and remove carefully the scum that has risen
it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil
before sugar was in use honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions though this substance has now given way to the juice of the sugar cane you
forteen ninetynine you
boil them up three days successively skimming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use you
the reason why the fruit is emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
from this example the process of preserving fruits by syrup would be easily comprehended
they should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they are turned you
in this way it is also that orange and lemon chips are preserved thank you for watching
marmalades jams and fruit pastes are of the same nature and are now in very general request you
marmalades and jams differ little from each other they are preserves of half liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits and sometimes part of the rinds with sugar you
that they may keep it as necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen o three you
in all the operations for preserve making when the preserving pan is used it should not be placed on the fire but on a trivet unless the jam is made on a hot plate when this is not necessary
confectionary серьяж
and speaking of confectionery it should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head from the various fruits flours herbs roots and juices which when boiled with sugar were formerly employed in pharmacy as well as for sweetmeats were called confections from the latin word confiercer to make up but the term confectionery embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary and so here they are including peter patbys
the thousand and one ornamental dishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner and they cannot profitably be made at home
however as late as the reign of our two last georges fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts you
the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems you
ices ices
at desserts or at some evening parties ice are scarcely to be dispensed with
the spattle is generally made of copper kept bright and clean the spattle is generally made of copper kept bright and clean
they should be taken immediately after the repast or some hours after because the taking of these substances during the process of digestion is apt to provoke indisposition so
once upon a time there was a king in the north who had won many wars but now he was old
the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled you
but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
so he asked the queen how do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning and she said you
then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
he is no bigger than other dragons said the tutor and if you were as brave as your father you would not fear him you
then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dwarf who owned all the treasure and took it from him
only one ring was left which the dwarf wore and even that was taken from him
so regan made a sword and sigurd tried it with a blow on a lump of iron and the sword broke you
then sigurd went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's blade and gave them to regan
so sigurd said that sword would do you
then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley you
but sigurd waited till half of him had crawled over the pit and then he thrust the sword graham right into his very heart you
sigurd said i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
but all men die and no brave man lets death frighten him from his desire
die thou fafnir and then fafnir died
then sigurd rode back and met regan and regan asked him to roast fafner's heart and let him taste of it you
so sigurd put the heart of fafnir on a stake and roasted it
there is sigurd roasting fafnir's heart for another when he should taste of it himself and learn all wisdom
that let him do then ride over hinfeld to the place where brunhild sleeps
there must she sleep till thou com'st for her waking rise up and ride for now sure she will swear the vow fearless of breaking
then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper and behold she was a most beautiful lady
then sigurd rode away and he came to the house of a king who had a fair daughter
lindburnhill's father told gunnar that she would marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower and thither they rode and gunnar set his horse at the flame but he would not face it
for one day when brunhild and gundren were bathing brunhild waded farthest out into the river and said she did that to show she was gundren's superior you
for her husband she said had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it you
not long to wait he said till the bitter sword stands fast in my heart and thou wilt not live long when i am dead you
there was once at a time a widower who had a son and a daughter by his first wife
from the very day that the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the man's children and not a corner to be found where they could get any rest so the boy thought that the best thing he could do was to go out into the world and try to earn his own bread
but his sister who was still at home fared worse and worse you
kiss me girl said the head
when the king entered and saw it he stood still as if he were in fetters and could not stir from the spot for the picture seemed to him so beautiful you
the youth promised to make all the haste he could and set forth from the king's palace
at last they came inside of land
well if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her casket into the sea you
what is my brother saying asked his sister again the elder brother told his sister that the heart of mu обéré decided the time for his silence and actions in that minute secreted himself from fear theayed be mu know who is still 같 hell him those are the people who swear in heaven
on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchenmaid who slept there to lend her a brush she told him that like i am my wife
she begged very prettily and got it
out on thee ugly bushy bride sleeping so soft by the young king's side on sand and stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with the cold snake out on thee ugly bushy bride sleeping so soft by the young king's side on sand and stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with the cold snake unpitied and unwept out on thee ugly bushy bride sleeping so soft by the young king's side on sand and stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with the cold snake
i shall come twice more and then never again said she
this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again
no one can tell how delighted the king was to get rid of that hideous bushy bride and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as day itself
there done for said the schoolmaster in a low key to the chouette out with your vitriol and mind your eye you
the two monsters took off their shoes and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses you
by means of this stratagem they followed so closely that although within a few steps of sarah and tom they did not hear them
sarah and her brother having again passed by the tapis franc arrived close to the dilapidated house which was partly in ruins and its open cellars formed a kind of gulf along which the street ran in that direction
in an instant the schoolmaster with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized seaton with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling you into this hole
no said the old brute grumblingly no not one ring what a shame you
tom seaton did not lose his presence of mind during this scene rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred you
ooo aah to lay a trap to catch us replied the thief
then addressing thomas seaton you know the plain of st denis you
did you see in the cabaret we have just left for i know you again the man whom the charcoal man came to seek you
cried the schoolmaster a thousand francs and i'll kill him
wretch i do not seek his life replied sarah to the schoolmaster
let's go and meet him
old boy it will pay for looking after thank you
well my wife shall be there said the schoolmaster you will tell her what you want and i shall see you
in the plain of st denis you
between st ois and the road of la revolte at the end of the road agreed
he had forgotten the address of the selfstyled panpainter you
the fiatca started the fiatca started
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcef could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge store and which merits a particular description
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate
at a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all albert's establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count's chasseur also
wait then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes you
very well at halfpast ten
is the countess up yet is the countess up yet
the valet left the room the valet left the room
good morning lucien good morning said albert your punctuality really alarms me you
you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was halfpast you
no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans
yes he has not much to complain of bourges is the capital of charles the seventh you
it is for that reason you see me so early
i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour you
pests i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them execrable you
besides that does not concern the home but the financial department
about what about the papers
in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders you
they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue from the tree from the barn which is broad and�� for n plötzlich absorbed  n unfree  and up
come come that is not bad said lucien you
with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years
france who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert's request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon
my very good friend and excellent neighbour replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions you
my father the comte de morcef although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal
i am scarcely credited thank you
then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated and
shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to a dot you
so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimneypiece he said today is the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly halfpast ten o'clock now promise me to remember this and expect me the twenty first of may at the same hour in the forenoon you
i reside in my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main building
now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your timepiece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself
that depends when do you leave
for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two you
then we shall not meet in paris you
i fear i shall not have that honour thank you
well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey you
what is the matter asked albert of france when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful you
i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
did you ever meet him previously to coming hither you
upon my honour then listen to me
he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto vecchio you
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the coliseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the banded peppino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled you
but said france the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel you
why really the thing seems to me simple enough thank you
talking of countries replied france of what countries the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early lifea life as marvellous as unknown that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy you
certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered you
my dear franz replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert de morcef is in danger help me to deliver him
what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what countries he a native you
i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from the hands of signor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern i did not very particularly care to remain
and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's side
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation you
and now my dear franz let us talk of something else
even the sun came out pale and watery at noon the sun came out pale and watery at noon
the colds and rheumatism of the rainy months vanished
asked a worker last sunday you did it when the young girls
well didn't they shoot us one man exhibited his arm in a sling another man wore a black cloak

whereupon the old executive committee left the hall thank you

fearful tamil cries down with the bolsheviki thank you for watching
upon my return i visited smallney no such accusation was made against me there after a brief conversation i left and that's all let anyone present make such an accusation
meanwhile the question of the status of the executive committee was agitating all minds
by declaring the assembly extraordinary conference it had been planned to block the reelection of the executive committee we signed to the national assembly by this decree i stated it on the ben riverérêt national reservoir at naples on a may snow and luscious ravenous plan it is the剛剛 and very celebrity tiago tonha i еще t nyt h punch before this preelection ofay타 ged nachta
but this worked both ways the last socialist revolutionist decided that if the congress had no power over the executive committee then the executive committee had no power over the congress
on the twentyseventh occurred the debate on the land question which revealed the differences between the agrarian program of the bolsheviki and the left socialist revolutionaries
the constituent assembly will not dare to break with the will of the people
followed him lenin listen to now with absorbing intensity listen to now with absorbing intensity
the first stage was the crushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of the industrial capitalists and the landowners whose interests are closely related

i swear answered sancho
i say so continued don quixote because i hate taking away anyone's good name
i say replied sancho that i swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship stays and congrats i may be able to let it out tomorrow
though your worship was not so badly off having in your arms the incomparable beauty you spoke of but i what did i have except the heaviest wax that i think i had in all my life you
unlucky me
didn't i say so worse luck to my lines said sancho you
it cannot be the more answered don quixote for those under enchantment do not let themselves be seen by any one you
if they do not let themselves be seen they let themselves be felt said sancho if not let my shoulders speak to the point
mine could speak too said don quixote but that is not a suspicion of reason for believing that what we see is the enchanted moor you
the officer turned to him and said well how goes it good man
sancho got up with pain enough in
to be brief he took the materials of which he made a compound mixing them all and boiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had come to perfection you
sancho panza who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin which was no small quantity
don quixote consented and he taking it with both hands in good faith and with a better will gulped it down and drained off very little less than his master you
if your worship knew that returned sancho woe betide me and all my kindred why did you let me taste it you
search your memory and if you find anything of this kind you need only tell me of it and i promise you by the order of the knighthood which i have received to procure you satisfaction and reparation to the utmost of your desire
then this is an inn said don quixote you
and a very respectable one said the innkeeper and a very respectable one said the innkeeper
the cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his master who halting to listen attentively was persuaded that some new adventure was coming until he clearly perceived that it was his squire who uttered them
he saw him rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that had his rage allowed him it is my belief he would have laughed you
sancho took it and as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming sancho my son drink not water drink it not my son for it will kill thee see here i have the blessed balsam and he held up the flask of liquor and with drinking two drops of it thou wilt certainly be restored
lobsters
when is a lobster not a lobster when it is a crayfish
this question and answer might well go into the primary of information for those who come to san francisco from the east for what is called a lobster in san francisco is not a lobster at all but a crayfish
the pacific crayfish however serves every purpose and while many contend that its meat is not so delicate in flavor as that of its eastern cousin the californian will estrangeously insist that it is better but of course something must always be allowed for the patriotism of the californian
a book could be written about this restaurant and then all would not be told for all its secrets can never be known
it was here that most magnificent dinners were arranged it was here that extraordinary dishes were concocted by chefs of worldwide fame it was here that lobster a la newberg reached its highest perfection and this is the recipe that was followed when it was prepared in the domonico
lobster ellen newberg
one pound of lobster meat one teaspoon full of butter one half pint of cream yolks of four eggs one wine glass of sherry lobster fat 
put this in a double boiler and let cook until thick stirring constantly
serve in a chafing dish with thin slices of dry toast tasty naan made with hot hostel style chicken in a chestnut cake
king of shellfish king of shellfish
one has to come to san francisco to partake of the king of shellfish the mammoth pacific crab
i say come to san francisco advisedly for while the crab is found all along the coast it is prepared nowhere so deliciously as in san francisco 
goby's passed with the fire and the little restaurant bearing his name and in charge of his widow in union square avenue has not attained the fame of the old place
it is possible that she knows the secret of preparing crab as it was prepared in the gobies of before the fire but his prestige did not descend to her you
gobi's crab stew
take the meat of one large crab scraping out all the fat from the shell
soak the crab meat in the sherry two hours before cooking
chop fine the onion sweet pepper and tomato with the rosemary serve hot with pullen circulation or greenrhino
heat this in a stewpan and when simmering add the sherry and crab meat and let all cook together with a slow fire for eight minutes also add rice flour whole grain flour and salt
serve in a chafing dish with toasted crackers or thin slices of toasted bread
lobster in miniature
so far it has been used mostly for garnishment of other dishes and it is only recently that the hofbrau has been making a specialty of them you
all of the better class restaurants however will serve them
this is the recipe for eight people and it is well worth trying if you are giving a dinner of importance
bisc of crawfish
take thirty crawfish from which remove the gut containing the gall in the following manner take firm hold of the crawfish with the left hand so as to avoid being pinched by its claws with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand pinch the extreme end of the central fin of the tail and with a sudden jerk the gut will be withdrawn t

as i thought that this was due to some fault in the earth i wanted to make these first experiments before i undertook my perseus
when i saw that this bust came out sharp and clean i set at once to construct a little furnace in the workshop erected for me by the duke after my own plans and design in the house which the duke had given me
it was an extremely difficult task and i was anxious to observe all the niceties of art which i had learned so as not to lapse into some error you
i in my turn feel the same desire and hope to play my part like them therefore my lord give me the leave to go i in my turn feel the same desire and hope to play my part like them
but beware of letting bandinello quit you rather bestow upon him always more than he demands for if he goes into foreign parts his ignorance is so presumptuous that he is just the man to disgrace our most illustrious school
i ask no further reward for my labours up to this time than the gracious favour of your most illustrious excellency i ask no further reward for my labours up to this time than the gracious favour of your most illustrious excellency
then i thanked him and said i had no greater desire than to show those envious folk that i had it in me to execute the promised work you
i had better look to my conduct for it had come to his ears that i relied upon his favour to take in first one man and then another you
i begged his most illustrious excellency to name a single person whom i had ever taken in
i said my lord i thank you and beg you to condescend so far as to listen to four words it is true that he lent me a pair of old scales two anvils and three little hammers which articles i begged his workman giorgio da cortona fifteen days ago to fetch back
giorgio came for them his health
i hope to prove on what account that scoundrel tries to bring me into disgrace thank you for watching
when he had heard this speech the duke rose up in anger and sent for bernardone who was forced to take flight as far as venice he and antonio landi with him
you had better put this to the proof and i will go at once to the bargello you
i am willing to enter into competition with the ancients and feel able to surpass them for since those early days in which i made the medals of pope clement i have learned so much that i can now produce far better pieces of the kind i think i can also outdo the coins i struck for duke alessandro which are still held in high esteem in like manner i could make for you large pieces of gold and silver plate as i did so often for that noble monarch king francis of france thanks to the great conveniences he allowed me without ever losing time for the execution of colossal statues or other works of the sculptor's craft
after several months were wasted and piero would neither work nor put men to work upon the piece i made him give it back
among artists certain enraged sculptors laughed at me and called me the new sculptor thank you for watching
now i hope to show them that i am an old sculptor if god shall grant me the boon of finishing my perseus for that noble piazza of his most illustrious excellency you
having this excellent resolve in heart i reached my home
but the middle son was little and lorn he was neither dark nor fair he was neither handsome nor strong
throwing himself on his knees before the king he cried o royal sire bestow upon me also a sword and a steed that i may up and away to follow my brethren you
but the king laughed him to scorn thou a sword he you
in sooth thou shalt have one but it shall be one befitting thy maiden size and courage if so small a weapon can be found in all my kingdom you
forthwith the grinning jester began shrieking with laughter so that the bells upon his motley cap were all set ajangling you
i did but laugh to think the sword of ethelrede had been so quickly found responded the jester and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailor's girdle his sword fell from his hand and gn ан culture was brainwashed toocolate the labourers' consultancy
one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes joining me today too vert
thou shalt have thy liberty he cried even though thou shouldst rend me in peace as the moment thou art free 
it had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful fairy with filmy wings that shone like rainbows in the moonlight
at this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten you
scissors grow a giant's height and save us from yoga's might thank you
he could see the ogre standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the chasm and gnashing his teeth each one of which was as big as a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone but it was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre was a little bit more than a millstone the ogre says the ogre the ogre says the ungly the ogre says the ungli the ogre says the ungly the ogre says the ungly the ogre says the ungly the ogre says the ungly
the sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him you
thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this dismal spot while i have the power to help thee you
he lifted the scissors and with one stroke destroyed the web and gave the fly its freedom you
a faint glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole
the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors you
as he uttered the words the scissors leaped out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shutters as easily as through its sheaves you
in a very short time the prince had crawled through the opening
while he stood looking around him in bewilderment a firefly alighted on his arm flashing its little lantern in the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me to guide you to a place of safety
what is to become of me cried the poor peasant
my grain must fall and rot in the field from over ripeness because i have not the strength to rise and harvest it then indeed must we all starve you
the grand dame whom he supplied with fagots the merchant whom he rescued from robbers the king's counsellor to whom he gave aid all became his friends
to him who could bring her back to her father's castle should be given the throne and kingdom as well as the princess herself so from far and near indeed from almost every country under the sun came knights and princes to fight the ogre
among those who drew back were ethelrede's brothers the three that were dark and the three that were fair you
but ethelrede heeded not their taunts you
so they all cried out long and loud long live the prince prince is all you
he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn open with the iron in order that grain may be deposited within it it feels only the wound the quiver of the germ and the joy of the fruit only arrive later
he had but just acquired a faith must he then reject it already
he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
to stand between two religions from one of which you have not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to batlike souls
marius was cleareyed and he required the true light thank you for watching
the halflights of doubt pained him
whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father you
his discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him
in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
they soon elbowed him abruptly
request kerferrak to come and talk with me said marius
what is to become of you said kerfraak what is to become of you said kerfraak
what are you going to do i do not know
silver gold here it is silver gold here it is
you will then have only a pair of trousers a waistcoat a hat and a coat and my boots thank you
that will be enough
no it is not good what will you do after that
do you know german no well yes
it
the clothes dealer was sent for the clothes dealer was sent for
he paid twenty francs for the castoff garments they went to the watchmakers they went to the watchmakers
he bought the watch for fortyfive francs mais dear bell ouais
hello i'd forgotten that said marius
the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot llatte gordonме you can go open university in la ch youth or best se hysteria promises letter and school trip offer online  llatht gordonmee but another dollar will do
i have ten francs left said marius the rain then dried up over the night and swelled it up again until the river abode called anglia took hold of theỗi dead relationship after theouts it pretttк stormed the region of kep kiddo with its horses and its
that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sous very slowly
one morning on his return from the law school marius found a letter from his aunt and the letter was in a sealed box
marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt with a respectful letter in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs
at that moment he had three francs left
wilder was rather surly after the ladies had floated away from the scene and he drank his liquor doggedly 
it was his fancy i suppose to revive certain sentimental relations which had it may be once existed between him and miss lake and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnifies an object in proportion as its pursuit is thwarted
the story of fridolin and wretch's pretty outlines
sit down beside me and i'll tell you the story i'll tell you the story
he assisted at it but took no part and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gabble and laughter like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance
but honest mark forgot that young ladies do not always come out quite alone and jump unassisted into their vehicles you
i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
you in the way marguerite but how you
well you might have had a woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive you
during this remark marguerite looked at me attentively you
my dear prudence i answered you do not know what you are saying
yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
because i am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm you
is that really the only reason
if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
honestly do you care for me a little a great deal
i fancied for a moment that i might give myself that happiness for six months you would not have it you insisted on knowing the means you
well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
i listened and i gazed at marguerite with admiration
when i thought that this marvelous creature whose feet i had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts my part in her life and that i was not yet content with what she gave me i asked if man's desire had indeed limits when satisfied as promptly as mine had been it reached after something further
truly she continued we poor creatures of chance have fantastic desire and inconceivable loves you
we are not allowed to have hearts under penalty of being hooted down and of ruining our credit
we no longer belong to ourselves
we stand first in their selfesteem last in their esteem thank you
never do they give you advice which is not lucrative
it means little enough to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they get dresses or a bracelet out of them and that they can drive in our carriage from time to time or come to our box at the theatre
such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and old age neither protects nor consoles
i thought i could accept the life which he offered me but what would you have
what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
marguerite tired out with this long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough put up her handkerchief to her lips and from that to her eyes
marguerite do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but in the name of heaven tear up the letter which i wrote to you and do not make me leave you tomorrow it would kill me
marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
here it is i have brought it back
i tore the letter into fragments and kissed with tears the hand that gave it to me
look here prudence do you know what he wants said marguerite you
he wants you to forgive him
one has to but he wants more than that what then you
i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled
the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake you
yes but if i should already ask for something what
well do it for me for i swear to you
there are bolts in the door wretch wretch
i don't know how it is but it seems to me as if i do
now go i can't keep my eyes open i can't keep my eyes open
it seemed to me as if this sleeping city belonged to me i searched my memory for the names of those whose happiness i had once envied and i could not recall one without finding myself the happier
education family feeling the sense of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sentinels so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first counsel of love all the more ardent because they seem so pure
the more a girl believes in goodness the more easily will she give way if not to her lover at least to love for being without mistrust she is without force and to win her love is a triumph that can be gained by any young man of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must they find it tempting how surely must they listen to the first voice which comes to tell its secrets through their bars and bless the hand which is the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil
with them the body has worn out the soul the senses have burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings you
they love by profession and not by instinct you
when a creature who has all her
they know not what proof to give thank you
in order to disturb the labourers in the field was one day devoured by a wolf because those whom he had so often deceived no longer believed in his cries for help
this is the same with these unhappy women when they love seriously
but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one draught all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
but to return to the first day of my liaison
when i reached home i was in a state of mad gaiety i was in a state of mad gaiety
the woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him
how why
my whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night
here are my orders tonight at vaudeville you
come during the third entrant thank you
the boxes filled one after another
only one remains empty the stage box
at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and marguerite appeared you
she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she looked the happier i should be
what is the matter with you tonight said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
you should go to bed she replied with that ironic air which went so well with her delicate and witty face you
where at home thanks for watching
you still love me can you ask
because you don't like seeing him
none the less i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and marguerite get into the carriage which was waiting for them at the door
old mr buzzard grinned you
this sounded like another story
he was curious about that blackheaded cousin of old mr buzzard very curious indeed
anyway he would find out
please mr buzzard please tell us the story he begged
now all mr buzzard is naturally goodnatured and accommodating and when peter begged so hard he just couldn't find it in his heart to refuse
way back in the days when grandpa buzzard had his little falling out with old king eagle and done fly so high he scorched the feathers off'n his head he had a cousin did grandpa buzzard and this cousin was just naturally lazy and no count
like most nocount people he used to make a regular nuisance of himself poking his nose into everybody's business and never tending to his own
wasn't anything going on that this trifling member of the buzzard family didn't find out about a metal inn he could ask more questions than peter rabbit can and anybody that can do that has got to ask a lot
everybody looked at peter and laughed the end
so we uns sit on the chimney tops whenever old jack frost gets to straying down where he have no business you
one day this nocount trifling cousin of grandpa buzzard get cold in his feet you
it was on the little old house a little old tumbledown house © transcript emily beynon
why he just stretched his full head as far down the chimney as he can and listened and listened you
but he don't mind that
will you all please speak a little louder he hollered down the chimney just like that please be silent
yes sah she sho'ly was plump scared
they like to choke that nocount buzzer to death
when he get home he try and try to brush the suit off but it don't get into the skin and it stay there but it doesn't stay there
a little sigh of satisfaction went round the circle of listeners thank you
it was just as good as one of grandfather frog's © transcript emily beynon
it seems very interesting love said he lifting his head and turning to her eyes too wringing my hand in silent rage and anguish but it's rather long i'll look at it some other time and meanwhile i'll trouble you for your keys my dear what keys
the keys of your cabinet desk drawer and whatever else you possess said he rising and holding out his hand you
the key of my desk in fact was at that moment in the log and the others were attached to it
now then sneered he we must have a confiscation of property you
and putting the keys into his pocket he walked into the library the software demo is approved by the german university ofhaiten and we are testing it
that and all replied the master and things were cleared away you
mr huntingdon then went upstairs
not that he is starting back she is very devil for spite she is very devil for spite
i didn't say i'd broken it did i returned he
i shall put you up on a small monthly allowance in future for your own private expenses and you needn't trouble yourself anymore about my concerns i shall look out for a steward my dear i won't expose you to the temptation
and as for the household matters mrs gribbs must be very particular in keeping her accounts we must go up on an entirely new plan you
what great discovery have you made now mr huntingen thank you
i've attended to the fraud you
not in many manners exactly it seems but it's best to keep out of the way of temptation you
here benson entered the candles and there followed a brief interval of i sitting still in my chair and he standing with his back to the fire silently triumphing in my despair
i know that day after day such feelings will return upon me
i try to look to him and raise my heart to heaven but it will cliff to the dust
o enxerche arsión o enxerche arsión
i knew well enough that he might be carried thousands of miles in the box car locked in perhaps without water or food you
i am sure i kissed lady and i've had terrible moments since when i seem to remember kissing mr jameson too in the excitement you
fortunately warner and the detective were keeping bachelor hall in the lodge 
out of deference to lydie they washed her dishes once a day and they concocted queer messes according to their several abilities you
miss eanes he said stopping me as i was about to go to my room upstairs how are your nerves tonight
i have none i said happily
i mean he persisted do you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual you
the most unusual thing i can think of would be a peaceful night
something is going to occur he said 
put on heavy shoes and some old dark clothes and make up your mind not to be surprised at anything subtitles by the amaraorg community
lily was sleeping the sleep of the just when i went upstairs and i hunted out my things cautiously benim benedictin emförce na mökko in nä di di conducido cum v tra ar kim memorial cam рав puk ta pe rita muerte es am feti r whooa
they were talking confidently together but when i came down they ceased him
there were a few preparations to be made the logs to be gone over winters to be instructed as to renewed vigilance and then after extinguishing the whole light we crept in the darkness through the front door and into the night
i ask no questions
once only somebody spoke and then it was an emphatic bit of profanity from dr stewart when he ran into a wire fence
i hardly know what i expected thank you
the doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt
i confess that just at that minute even sunnyside seemed a cheerful spot you
in spite of myself i drew my breath in sharply
it was alex armed with two longhandled spades
the doctor kept a keen lookout but no one appeared
there's one thing sure i'll not be suspected of complicity
a doctor is generally supposed to be a hand yard at burying folks than at jigging them up you can figure that out by your own week at least they're 만�own when the doctors are out there getting out of the japon net that's the way it happens jonny
i held onto him frantically and somehow i got there and looked down
then hope i fear
mr and mrs hattersley have been seeing it a grove of fortnight and as mr hargrave is still absent and the weather was remarkably fine i never passed a day without seeing my two friends millicent and esther either there or here
no unless you can tell me when to expect him home
i can't he don't want him do you
it is a resolution you already formed long ago
we all have a bit of a liking for him at the bottom of our hearts though we can't respect it all but he's still fun meat
no i'd rather be like myself bad as i am
never mind my plain speaking said i it is from the best of motives you
but tell me should you wish your sons to be like mr huntingdon or even like yourself you
oh no i couldn't stand that
fire and fury
now don't pour us into a tempest at that thank you
but hang it that's not my fault thanks for watching
not ears for she's only five and twenty
what did you make of me and the children to be sure that were you hurt to death between them you
i know they are bless them
if i would mean to the library i would mean to the library
i sought out and put into his hands two of millicent's letters one dated from london and written during one of his wildest seasons of reckless dissipation the other in the country during a lucid interval
the former was full of trouble and anguish not accusing him but deeply regretting his connection with his profligate companions abusing mr grimsby and others insinuating bitter things against mr huntingdon and most ingenuously throwing the blame of her husband's misconduct on the other man's shoulders
i've been a cursed rascal god knows said he as he gave it a earthy squeeze but you see if i don't make amends for it dd me if i don't
if you intend to reform invoke god's blessing his mercy and his aid not his curse
god help me then for i'm sure i need it god help me then for i'm sure i need it
where's millicent where's millicent
nay not i said he turning around and pushing it towards me
millicent flew to thank me overwhelming its gratitude
cried she i couldn't have influenced him i'm sure by anything that i could have said you
you never tried me milly said he you
after that they will prepare to their country home
but how am i to get over the ten or twelve days that must yet elapse before they go
for none could injure me as he has done thank you for watching
the world stares me in the face like a guilty confession but it is true i hate him i hate him you
i sometimes think i ought to give him credit for the good feeling he simulates so well and then again i think it is my duty to suspect him under the peculiar circumstances in which i am placed
i have done well to record them so minutely thank you
they had taken themselves to their work i less to divert my mind than to deprecate conversation had provided myself with a book i
i am too well acquainted with your character and conduct to feel any real friendship for you if i am without your talent for dissimulation i cannot assume the appearance of it
upon perusing this she turned scarlet and bit her lip
you may go millicent until following a while
will you
you are suspicious
if i were suspicious i replied i should have discovered your infamy long before you
i enjoy humanlike ramble as well as you i answered steadily fixing my eyes up on her and strawberry happens to be one of my favorite resorts
she colored again excessively and remained silent pressing her finger against her teeth and gazing into the fire the corporal put her hand in herpiece and walked up to heruci took the trasnler out and took up her chair as it was asked for her da observers drew up a column to the left of the line and they quanidly stood together before that barch recorded the first of being countredhaupts
i watched her a few moments to the feeling of malevolent gratification then moving towards the door i calmly asked if she had anything more to say you
yes yes
suppose i do
she paused in evident disconcertion and perplexity mingled with anger she dared not show so
i cannot renounce what is dearer than life she muttered in a low hurried tone you
if you are generous here is a fitting opportunity for the exercise of your magnanimity if you are proud here am i your rival ready to acknowledge myself your adepter for an act of the most noble forbearance
i shall not tell him
give me no thanks it is not for your sake that i refrain it is not for your sake that i refrain
and millicent will you tell her
i would not for much that you should know the infamy and disgrace of our relation
you use hard words mrs huntingdon but i can pardon you you
how dare you mention his name to me
sure you've looked around everywhere boy yes father quite
i'm going home to breakfast
shall i come too father no
stop here till sir risdon comes down and tell him i'm very sorry that we should have cleared out last night only a born fool saw gerry and andy's lobster boat coming into the cove and came running to say it was a party from the cutoff yes father
tell him not to be uneasy 'tis all right and i'll have everything clear away tonight
the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin where archie raystroke lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down by sleep you
what a queer dream he thought to himself you
but how queer for mr gerva to be talking like that to andrew teale the boy who helped the cook
and why did andy call mr gurr father thank you for watching
there was an interval of thinking over this knotty question during which the low whistling went on
and i'm hungry too time always up i suppose
no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint mist hung like wreaths of smoke you
what did they say false alarm tell sir risdon they would clear all away tonight see if anything had been left about lobster boat you
once out of that room he could run and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunt him down
oh those bars he mentally exclaimed and he was advancing towards them when just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of boottoes against stonework and ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young midshipman instead his fast� mercy brushesser prostrated against them and he let him free and thrust his hands against the pieces so they could not go any further and reached over the room across the garden to the unmass非常 summertime he very quickly lessened and out ofggak of his clothes and face that he knew that the furniture of the main building was his own
rem was the first to recover from his surprise rem was the first to recover from his surprise
hello he said i am a babylonian in adonly i am a babylonian in adonly i am a babylonian in adonly
go round and open the door i was shut in last night by mistake
i saw you last night and wondered whose boy he was
it was you
nonsense you
won't do said ram grinning you
think i don't know you mr orfizer i don't know you
won't do said rem quickly i know you
i've been playing the spy that's what you've been doing who locked you in
archie stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
he has gone to give the alarm thought the prisoner and he looked excitedly round for a way of escape you
nothing but the chimney presented itself you
a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curved dirk glanced at the edge ran to the window and began to cut at one of the bars labor in vain
he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realized that the attempt was madness
the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating earselling sound as he found that now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twentyfour hours he would not get through
but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the dirk into its sheath you
no i can't part with
but i'll yes i'll give you a guinea if you will let me out thank you
guinny said the boy think i'll do it for her guinea yes a biggernies hold hearts
be quick there's a good fellow i want to get away at once you
not you only a sham
why your clothes don't fit you and your caps put on all skiru you
never mind about that let me out of this place you
i told you a fisher boy cried archie impatiently but trying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
not you look like a wild beast in a cage like a monkey you insolent you
archie checked himself and the boy laughed the end
it was your turn yesterday it's mine today what a game it's mine today
you laughed and fleered at me when i was on the cutter's deck you
i say you do look like a rummin' just like a big monkey in a show
ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long low fit of laughter
you ropes and me he said you
why i could tie you up in a knot and heave you off the cliff any day what a game you
bit of a middy fed on a salt tack and weevilly biscuit talk of giving me rope's end you
once more will you come and let me out no
to his astonishment the boy did not flinch but thrust his own arms through placing them about the middy's waist clenching his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle you
i'm sorry seemed any good spears last night mr gurr eh we'll fix you up
yes sir but he may turn up on the cliff at any moment you
yes men quite ready yes sir
that's right of course well armed thank you
as soon as the signal comes we shall push off

so shall we yes sir thank you
you don't think mr gurr that they would dare to injure him if he was so unlucky as to be caught
well sir said the master hesitating smugglers are smugglers you
i'm sure you're right sir smugglers are smugglers indeed subtitles by the amaraorg community
i didn't mean to beg pardon sir didn't mean any harm
i'm getting very anxious about mr raystroke start at once sir
no wait another half hour
very illadvised thing to do thank you
then i must request that you will not make it again very true thank you
awkward
yes sir of course
say awkward in the future not awkward thank you
i mean all alone by myself sir
what for they're aren't a public house for ten miles didn't mean that you
then what did you mean speak out and don't do the double shuffle all over my clean deck globally enormous
hopping about like a cat on hot bricks
now then why do you want to go ashore there's nothing waiting for my new company to do
beg pardon didn't mean it out sir said the sailor touching his forelock you
yes sir said the man humbly shall i go at once sir you
no wait
keep a sharp lookout on the cliff to see if mr raystroke is making signals for a boat i have no idea at this point if he's ready to battle this ledge barch goblin not intense to give a perfect déb sealed in by a simple one initiative сил
he swung round walked aft and began sweeping the shore again with his glass while the master and dick exchanged glances which meant a great deal you
at last the little lieutenant could bear the anxiety no longer
pipe away the men to that boat there he said and as the crew sprang in we also shall get talk about it
now mr gurr he said i'm only going to say one thing to you in the way of instructions yes sir you
beg pardon sir said the master deprecatingly you
steady my lads steady cried the master keep stroke and then he began to make plans as to his first proceedings on getting ashore you
say mr goerk said dick after one of these searches you wouldn't run away ivy c v aaf
mr raystoke sir don't be a fool
what track them off yonder you
gerd glanced round to see if the men were looking and then said rather huskily but kindly you
ah ejaculated dick sadly thanks for watching

i hope not dick i hope not but smugglers don't stand at anything sometimes
i do assure you there's nothing here but what you may see thank you
if you'd let me finish you'd know said gerg roughly one of our boys is missing seen him up here the door panel said miss come to cuid carved hers width around cãos here is fine edri was a good young man he would come here to care of the benches of his wife gerg played public itinerary and the chapel woodcarve 
boy about seventeen with a red cap no sir indeed i'm not
don't know as he's been seen about here do you said the girl looking at her searchingly no sir you
the poor lad her face would tell tales like print
i said a lad about seventeen in a red cap like yours said gur very shortly
the man shook his head and stared as if he didn't half understand the drift of what was said well that was a much sweeter
here my lad where's your master where's your master
i say where's your master where's your master
ger turned away impatiently again and signing to his men to follow the owl began to tramp up the steep track leading toward the hose with the rabbits scuttling away among the firs and showing their white cottony tails for a moment as they darted down into their holes
i don't know muttered dick and the men can't be sure end card
ger saluted and stayed at his business while the baronet who had turned saluer and more careworn than his lot drew a breath full of relief one of your shipboys he said you
a lad looking like a common sailor and wearing a red cap no said sir risdon you
i have seen no one answering to the description here
beg pardon sir but can you as a gentleman assure me that he is not here certainly sir you
surely cried sir risdon excitedly you
service and assignment thank you
lady grimm looked ghastly lady grimm looked ghastly
you do not know no
i'm from the cutter lying off the coast
don't cry he said i was obliged to come you've done what you can
and—and you have not found out anything came in quick frightened tones
i wish you would believe me that i am in as great trouble about it as you are
that my father sir risdon graeme has smuggled goods here
he could not help it he hates the smugglers you shall not tell
pray pray say you will not archie was silent you
then as archie stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he heard the faint rustling once more and again all was silent you
he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full of vexation injur d'amour propre as the french call our love of our own dignity of which archibald raystroke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british officer had a pretty good stock
and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
cold water came on this idea directly as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him you
i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless set of people who would stop at nothing you
no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would knock me about you
the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could you
to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest point and signal for help unless a boat's crew were already searching for him how to escape you
the window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone sill you
next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an oldfashioned marble mantelpiece fireplace chimney you

everyone who is turbulent has been found by gameranath poth the testimony of the oldest biblical narrative regarding the sojourn of the hebrews in egypt is also in perfect accord with the picture which the contemporary egyptian inscriptions give of the period
the absence of detailed reference to the hebrews is therefore perfectly natural thank you for watching
it seems probable that not all but only part of the tribes which ultimately coalesce into the hebrew nation found their way to egypt
the stories regarding joseph their traditional father ephraim and manasseh imply that these strong central tribes possibly together with the southern tribes of benjamin and judah were the chief actors in this opening scene in israel's history
the biblical narratives apparently disagree regarding the duration of the sojourn in egypt the biblical narratives apparently disagree regarding the duration of the sojourn in egypt

here moses learned the lessons that were essential for his training as a leader and deliverer of his people thank you
after the capture of jericho certain of them went up with the southern tribes to conquer southern palestine the
many modern scholars draw the conclusion from the biblical narrative that it was from the canaanites that moses first learned of yahweh or as the distinctive name of israel's god was translated by later jewish scribes jehovah
do the ariat seber traditions imply that the ancestors of the israelites were worshippers of jehovah we shall also see them speeding too the sheikhs because he was courageously muscle them for the sake of this people so this was actually the reason why there was a lot of controversy bye

captain murdock
but marsport had flourished enough to kill it off nasa jet propulsion laboratory california institute of technology

they were safe from protection racketeers there none bothered to come so far out thanks for watching
the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth thanks for watching
captain murdock was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men to be continued
the pressure was enough to get them for him
gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
i've got a free hand and we're going to run this the way we would on earth
your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
the first man making a shakedown will get the same treatment we're going to use on the stonewall boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
he picked out five of the men including gordon you five will come with me you five will come with me
the rest of you can team up any way you want tonight pick any route that's open okay men let's go let's go
bruce gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick and murdock's eyes fell on him earth cop earth cop
two years gordon admitted 
for a second gordon cursed himself
he began wondering about security then
nobody had tried to get in touch with him
there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim phosphor bulb glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
moving in two groups of threes at opposite sides of the street they began their beat with fairly good rhythm
there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lack of air
gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finally turned club in his hands
gordon's eyes popped at that
he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now the club was moving now
the other four cops had come in reluctantly that man
he brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys
they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cops started off
to find a phone and call the wagon
we're not using wagons murdock told him line them up line them up
if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were clubbed carefully if they stood still they were hit from behind
murdock indicated one who stood with his shoulders shaking and tears running down his cheeks
the captain's face was as sick as gordon's felt the captain's face was as sick as gordon's felt
i want the name of every man
colonel they'd kill me i don't know i don't know
murdock took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tufts to be continued
if he should turn up dead i'll know you
trouble began brewing shortly after though thanks for watching
murdock sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
in the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men who'd been beaten before rob
get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
but the captain stirred finally sighing the captain said
no the cops are giving me we're covered gordon we're covered
but the stonewall gang is backing wayne
but it's going to be tough on them
bruce gordon grimaced i've got a yellow ticket from security
murdock blinked he dropped his eyes slowly he dropped his eyes slowly
what makes you think wayne will be reelected
nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
ever see a martian election
no you're a firster he can't lose he can't lose
and then hell is going to pop and this whole planet may be blown wide open thank you
it fitted with the dire predictions of security and what the spying gordon was going to do according to them subtitles by the amaraorg community
he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner anotherぐだんいい早食べたい kind of a guy who was like oh what's going on and he's like oh they have got myths wanting to bait us back in the restaurant again i'm going to walk down the street it's almost like a little pub with authoritarian communities that walk with the same kind ofolor so this is thelerini of boyough서 theater in чемý un самый хорошийaresmõ a uau m ר n o
cost 'em more but they'd be respectable
because izzy is always honest according to how he sees it
but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
the groups grew more experienced and murdock was training a new squad every night
it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
this could lead to abuses as he'd seen on earth
but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor wayne was reelected
it was night outside and the phosphor bulbs at the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house
it had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down
and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that haley's system was working
gordon hit the signal switch and the mars speaker let out a shrill whistle you
guns suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
you can't do it to me
i'm reformed i'm going straight
you damned cops can't o'neal was blubbering o'neal was blubbering
one look was enough the work papers had the telltale overthickening of the signature that had showed up on other papers obviously forgeries
some turned away as gordon and the other cop went to work but most of them weren't squeamish thanks for watching
when it was over the two picked up their whimpering captive
jenkins the other cop had been holding the wallet
must have been making a big contact in something fiftyfifty fiftyfifty
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
when gordon and jenkins came back murdock tossed the money to them split it and spent the rest of it on the disc blender where he found 기 대표
whatever comes to hand guv'nor thanks for watching
like this social call gordon asked him this social call gordon asked him

a thousand interest at ten percent a week standard right yeah
gordon had heard of the friendly interest charged on the side here but he shook his head wrong izzy that's okay we'll look this over yes please thank you there was someone close if we weren't wrong i guess he had a good expression health like a cat called he didn't care very much  fellow hilbert was off to the  wow now we can't be grounded we're rude who cares if you guys are standing out here and laughing i get it and eric got caught but it makes no sense you had one of the facts then your wake up call welcome to the old university what week was that yeah finger who pressed that he's reading it for the first time i found it probably for the first time in my life i thought it might be shback's new job she says he zac

he pulled out the bills and handed them over
thanks izzy thanks yourself thanks izzy
the kid pocketed the money cheerfully nodding
the little guy knew mars as few others did apparently from all sides
and if any of the other cops had private rackets of their own izzy was undoubtedly the man to find it out and use the information with a beat such as that even going halves and with all the graft at the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped onto the bench i'm a real出來 that i'm afraid of no matter how ugly i am memory is what i am sorry for everything that's gone it's not eeny meeny miny moe do tell 'bout all about love i solution's a game of opponent love bleffin' gruebe over woo 아이들 백을enda

old mr dinsmore had accepted a pressing invitation from his granddaughter and her husband to join the party and with the addition of servants it was a large one you
as they were in no haste and the confinement of a railroad car would be very irksome to the younger children it had been decided to make the journey by water you
there were no sad leavetakings to mar their pleasure the children were in wild spirits and all seemed cheerful and happy as they sat or stood upon the deck watching the receding shore as the vessel steamed out of the harbour
at length the land had quite disappeared nothing could be seen but the sky overhead and a vast expanse of water all round and the passengers found leisure to turn their attention upon each other
there are some nicelooking people on board remarked mr travilla in an undertone to his wife you
besides ourselves added cousin ronald laughing you
yes she answered that little group yonder a young minister and his wife and child i suppose you
and what a dear little fellow he is just about the age of our harold i should judge
do you son was the smiling rejoinder
he certainly looks like a very nice little boy
suppose you and he shake hands frank
i do indeed though probably comparatively few are aware that tobacco is the cause of their ailments
doubtless that is the case remarked mr dinsmore you
with all my heart if you will step into the gentleman's cabin where there is a light you
he led the way the others all following and taking out a slip of paper read from it in a distinct tone loud enough to be heard by those all about him without disturbing the other passengers
one drop of nicotine extract of tobacco placed on the tongue of the dog will kill him in a minute the hundredth part of a grain pricked under the skin of a man's arm will produce nausea and fainting
the halfdozen cigars which most smokers use a day contain six or seven grains enough if concentrated and absorbed to kill three men and a pound of tobacco according to its quality contains from one quarter to one and a quarter ounces
is it strange then that smokers and chewers have a thousand ailments
that the french polytechnic institute had to prohibit its use on account of its effects upon the mind you
notice the multitude of sudden deaths and see how many are smokers and chewers you
in a small country town seven of these mysterious providences occurred within the circuit of a mile all directly traceable to tobacco and any physician on a few moments reflection can match this fact by his own observation
and then such powerful acids produce intense irritation and thirst thirst which water does not quench you

no sir what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own you
for you are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are god's
we certainly have no right to injure our bodies either by neglect or selfindulgence
and again i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice wholly acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service
it must require a good deal of resolution for one who has become fond of the indulgence to give it up remarked mr daly you
no doubt no doubt returned mr lilburn but if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
there was a pause broken by young horace who had been watching a group of men gathered about a table at the further end of the room the man who had been watching a group of men gathered about a table at the further end of the room
they are gambling yonder and i'm afraid that young fellow is being badly fleeced by the middleaged man opposite you
the eyes of the whole party were at once turned in that direction the eyes of the whole party were at once turned in that direction
no sir he is not here
and the door was slammed violently too
now the voice came from the skylight overhead apparently and with a fierce imprecation the irate gamester rushed upon deck and ran hither and thither in search of his tormentor
his victim who had been looking on during the little scene and listening to the mysterious voice in
what does it mean cried one you
a ventriloquist aboard of course returned another let's follow and see the fun
i wonder which of us it is remarked the first looking hard at our party i don't know but come on you
that fellow nick ward is a noted black lagoon ruffian had his nose broken in a fight and is sensitive on the subject was cheating of course you
who asked the mate i've seen none up here though there are some in the steerage you
they heard him in with a cool phlegmatic indifference most exasperating to one in his present mood you
a man of giant size and herculean strength had laid aside his pipe and slowly rising to his feet seized the scoundrel in his powerful grasp you
let me go yelled ward making a desperate effort to free his arms
i thinks no i thinks i did you von messen returned his captor not relaxing his grasp in the least you
the german released his prisoner and the latter slunk away with muttered threats and imprecations upon the head of his tormentor you
mr lilburn and mr daly each at a different time sought out the young man words intended victim and tried to influence him for good you
yet there was gambling again the second night between ward and several others of his profession you
they kept it up till after midnight
then mr lilborn waking from his first sleep in a stateroom near by thought he would break it up once more you
an intense voiceless excitement possessed the players for the game was a close one and the stakes were very heavy
they bent eagerly over the board each watching with feverish anxiety his companion's movements each casting now and again a gloating eye upon the heap of gold and greenbacks that lay between them and at times half stretching out his hand to clutch it
a deep groan startled them and they sprang to their feet pale and trembling with sudden terror each holding his breath and straining his ear to catch a repetition of the dread sound
but all was silent and after a moment of anxious waiting they sat down to their game again trying to conceal and shake off their fears with a forced unnatural laugh
it came from under the table gasped jord look what's there look yourself you
what can it have been they asked each other
oh nonsense what fools we are what fools we are
it was the last game of cards for that trip
the captain coming in shortly after the sudden flight of the gamblers took charge of the money and the next day restored it to the owners you
to elsie's observant eyes it presently became evident that the dailies were in very straitened circumstances you
oh how kind how very kind mrs daly said with tears of joy and gratitude we have hardly known how we should meet the most necessary expenses of this trip but have been trying to cast our care upon the lord asking him to provide
and how wonderfully he has answered our petitions you
elsie answered pressing her hand affectionately are we not sisters in christ you
you are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus
you are all one in christ jesus
we feel my husband and i that we are only the stewards of his bounty and because he has said inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me it is the greatest privilege and delight to do anything for his people
there's iron they say in all our blood and a grain or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
margaret said mr hale as he returned from showing his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mr thornton made his confession of having been a shopboy
you don't mean that you thought me so silly you don't mean that you thought me so silly
i really like that account of himself better than anything else he said
his statement of having been a shop boy was the thing i liked best of all
you who were always accusing people of being choppy at helston you
i don't think mr hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some parts of what he said
his father dying in miserable circumstances
why it might have been in the workhouse
his father speculated wildly failed and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace
all his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
no one came forwards to help the mother and this boy
at least no friend came forwards immediately and miss thornton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out you
so they left milton
how tainted asked her father you
oh papa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his iron nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
not vicious he never said that
improvident and selfindulgent were his words you
margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgment which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
however out it came
papa i do think mr thornton a very remarkable man but personally i don't like him at all you
and i do said her father laughing
personally as you call it and all you
i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
good night child you
there were several other signs of something wrong about mrs hale you
she and dixon held mysterious consultations in a bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was a custom when any distress of her mistress called upon her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dixon left it and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
but though she received caresses and fond words back again in such profusion as would have gladdened her formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
she lay awake very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother you
a servant to give dixon permanent assistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attentions she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
visiting register offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she met bessie higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
well busy how are you
better and not better if you know what that means you
not exactly replied margaret smiling
i am better at not being torn to pieces by coughing of nights but i am weary and tired of milton and longing to get away to the land of boolah and when i think i'm farther and farther off my heart sinks and i'm no better i'm worse
margaret turned round to walk alongside of the girl in her feeble progress homeward you
but for a minute or two she did not speak
at last she said in a low voice
dramatic music bessie do you wish to die dramatic music
bessie was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
not worse than many others i reckon
but what was it
you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton you
i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly
i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze you
as they turned up into a small court opening out into a squalid street bessie said you
you'll not be daunted if father's at home and speaks a bit gruffish at first you
but nicholas was not at home when they entered
gaspessi at last you
bessie took a long and feverish draught and then fell back and shut her eyes you
margaret bent over and said bessie don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or may have been you
remember who gave it to you and made it what it is thank you
now i'll not have my wench preached to you
but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of life it was to be you
i believe what i see and no more you
that's what i believe young woman you
i don't believe all i hear no not by a big deal
but who's come at last and who's welcome as long as he'll keep from preaching on what he knows not about you
it's simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work
but the girl only pleaded the more with margaret
don't think hardly on him he's a good man he is you
i sometimes think i shall be moped with sorrow even in the city of god if either is not there you
the feverish colour came into her cheeks and the feverish flame into her eye you
but you will be there father you shall oh my heart
she put her hand to it and became ghastly pale you
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
presently the spasm that foreshadowed death had passed away and bessie roused herself and said you
i'll go to bed it's best place but catching at margaret's gown you'll come again i know you will but just say it
i will come tomorrow said margaret
margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
she was late for tea at home you
have you met with a servant dear you've met with a servant dear
no mamma that anne buckley would never have done
suppose i try said mr hale you
i'm sorry everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty now let me try
i may be the cinderella to put on the slipper after all you
what would you do papa how would you set about it you
well i would apply it to some good housemother to recommend me one known to herself or her servants you
i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry very good but we must first catch our housemother i'm sorry
the mother of whom he spoke to us said margaret you
mr thornton the only mother he has i believe said mr hale quietly
i shall like to see her she must be an uncommon person her mother added you
perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
she sounded to be such a careful economical person that i should like any one out of the same family you
my dear said mr hell alarmed pray don't go off on that idea you
i am sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
take notice that this is not my kind of haughtiness papa if i have any at all which i don't agree to though you're always accusing me of it you
i don't know positively that it is hers either but from little things i have gathered from him i fancy so
they cared too little to ask in what manner her
the act said that in case of difference of opinion there must be a ballot thank you
he went up to the table and striking it with his fingerring he shouted loudly a ballad you
he was shouting for the very course sergey ivanovitch had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same vindictiveness though in a more seemly form on the other side
shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order a ballad
we shed our blood for our country thank you
the confidence of the monarch no checking the accounts of the marshal he is not a cashier but that's not the point
thank you thank you
they express the most implacable hatred thank you
levin did not in the least understand what was the matter and he marvelled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about fleuroff should be put to the vote
he forgot as sergey ivanovitch explained to him afterwards this syllogism that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure flerov's right to vote that to secure the recognition of flerov's right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act
but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement
to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar
he particularly liked the way one greywhiskered waiter who showed a scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly
levin advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to sergey ivanovitch with the question where am i to put it
yn ystod y gweithredu mae'r rhain yn cael eu gwneud yn ystod y gweithredu seulgi iwniwch brown
that is a matter for each man's own decision he said severely you
having put it in he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left hand too and so he thrust it in though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background
a hundred and twentysix for admission ninetyeight against thank you
sang over the voice of the secretary who could not pronounce the letter r
then there was a laugh a button and two knots were found in the box
but the old party did not consider themselves conquered
in reply snitkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him the affection they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service
this expression in the marshal's face was particularly touching to levin because only the day before he had been at his house about his trusty business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kindhearted fatherly man
if there are men younger and more deserving than i let them serve
and the marshal disappeared through a side door thanks for watching
they were to proceed immediately to the election
two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of snedkov and a third had been robbed of his uniform you
on learning this the new party had made haste during the dispute about fleuroff to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the stripped gentlemen and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting
levin did not care to eat and he was not smoking he did not want to join his own friends that is sergey ivanovitch stepan arkadyevitch sversky and the rest because vronsky in his equerry's uniform was standing with them in eager conversation you
 hello at pretty woman sidewalks here at misah
he's such a blackguard he's such a blackguard
i have told him so but it
these persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard thank you for watching
shall we go on your excellency fine champagne
last year at our district marshal nikola ivanovich's
oh still just the same always at a loss the landowner answered with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be
why what is there to understand
there is no meaning in it at all
then two one must keep up connections
it's a moral obligation of assad thank you
and then to tell the truth there's one's own interests you
they are proprietors of a sod but we are the land owners you
that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
if we are laying out a garden planning one before the house you know and there you have a tree
well and how is your land doing
but one's work is thrown in for nothing
oh well one does it what would you have what would you have
and what's more the landowner went on leaning his elbows on the window and chatting on my son i must tell you has no taste for it you
so there will be no one to keep it up and yet one does it subtitles by the amaraorg community
we walked about the fields and the garden no said he stepan vyslovich everything's well looked after but your garden's neglected
to my thinking i'd cut down the lime tree thank you
here you have thousands of limes and each would make two good bundles of bark thank you
you're married i heard said the landowner you
yes it's rather strange he went on
the landowner chuckled under his white moustaches the end
why don't we cut down our parks for timber thank you
said levin returning to a thought that had struck him
there's a class instinct too of what one ought and ought not to do
there's the peasants too i wonder at them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
without a return too add a simple loss
captain lake did not look at all like a london dandy now
there was a very natural savagery and dejection there and a wild lure in his yellow eyes rachel sat down

stanley stanley it would be mercy to kill me she broke her again you
bright and natty were the chintz curtains and the little toilet set out not inelegantly and her pet piping goldfinch asleep on his perch with his bit of sugar between the wires of his cage her pillow so white and unpressed with its little edging of lace
when he came back to the drawingroom a toiletbottle of eaudecologne in his hand with her lace handkerchief he bathed her temples and forehead then gtz
there was nothing very brotherly in his look as he peered into her pale sharp features during the process you
there don't mind me she said sharply and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle he had just set down and went swiftly to her room
and she threw back her veil and going hurriedly to the toilet mechanically surveyed herself in the glass you
rachel lick rachel lick what are you now
i'll stay here that is in the drawingroom she answered and the face was withdrawn
he slackened his pace and tapped sharply at the little window of that modest postoffice at which the young ladies in the pony carriage had pulled up the day before and within which luke waggett was wont to sleep in a sort of wooden box that folded up and appeared to be a chest of drawers all day
luke took care of mr larkin's dogs and groomed mr wilder's horse and cleaned up his dogcart for mark being close about money and finding that the thing was to be done more cheaply that way put up his horse and dogcart in the postoffice premises and so evaded the livery charges of the brandon arms
but luke was not there and captain lake recollecting his habits and his haunt hurried on to the silver lion which has its cable towards the common only about a hundred steps away for distances are not great in gilingdon
here were the flow of soul and of stout long pipes long yarns intolerably long credits and the humble cape graces of the town resorted thither for the pleasures of a club life and often reveled deep into the small hours of the morning
lose no time and i will give you half a crown
luke stuck on his greasy wideawake and in a few minutes more the dogcart was trundled out into the lane and the horse harnessed went between the shafts with that wonderful cheerfulness with which they bear to be called up under startling circumstances at unseasonable hours

cosette had waked up
jean valjean had placed her near the fire
you will wait for me at a lady's house i shall come to fetch you i shall come to fetch you
everything is arranged and nothing is said fauchelevent everything is arranged and nothing is
i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
that's where the difficulty lies
it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out you will carry her out
and she will hold her tongue i answer for that
fauchelevent grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean you
you understand father madeleine the government will notice it thank you
jean valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving jean valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving
fosh levon went on fosh levon went on
it is tomorrow the time to bring you
then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community you
that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel where it was written and at a disbelieving cost which i did not understand that it bore fruit from your heart the yokiness of her face the righteousness of her face paint someone as beautiful as she was who saw the soul as beautiful as what existed on earth and i wanted to ask you tell me or write something here slimmingly passionately savoring something realised something there is nothing hundred what i will argue in the next byron bay article further no need to à th game no words i didn't finish my sentence for the yakuza but your sarivallish activities with me in lecture who are like every night a foreign saying woman can once againいう erredersa n đang thà  tă hacăあーăi a helmet hat�hămă cupfr ча reciprocanghêş treehâê
that the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased
that he fauchelevent was to nail up the coffin in the cell raise the stone in the chapel and blow the corpse into the vault
and then that there was another the empty coffin
what is that empty coffin what is that empty coffin
asked jean valjean fauchelevent replied 'you've seen with your eyes what my ghost that is'íveis phillip a south bend and its vent broke we're finding yourself in the infamy ouncé

this offers the means give me some information in the first place you talk about brace operation
how long is the coffin six feet six feet
it is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one leads into the convent the other into the church what church
the church in the street the church which anyone can enter
have you the keys to those two doors
no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent and the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church and the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church
only to allow the undertaker's men to enter when they come to get the coffin
who nails up the coffin i do i do
who spreads the pool over it you
not another man except the police doctor can enter the dead room that is even written on the wall
could you hide me in that room tonight when everyone is asleep
about three o'clock in the afternoon
i shall be hungry i will bring you something i shall be hungry i will bring you something
you can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock thank you
fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger joints but that is impossible
but impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank you
had been in worse straits than this
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape subtitles by the amaraorg community
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to economise his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean's gloomy talents
you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nail the top plancon loosely good and what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze
a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze the man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze
who is there who has not said to a cat do come in
the over prudent cats as they are and because they are cats sometimes incur more danger than the audacious 
but jean valjean's coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself he grumbled you
if you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right i am sure of getting you out of the coffin

that is settled father fauchelevent all will go well thank you
on the following day as the sun was declining the very rare passersby on the boulevard du maine pulled off their hats to an oldfashioned hearse ornamented with skulls crossbones and tears
this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a huge corpse with drooping arms

poor ransom announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery but in reality he had never been so beotian as at that moment poor ransom announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery but in reality he had never been so beotian as at that moment you
the women he had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft clime and it was not often they exhibited the tendency he detected and cursorily deplored in mrs looney's sister
ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very provincial
he was sorry for her but he saw in a flash that no one could help her that was what made her tragic thank you for watching
she could not defend herself against a rich admiration a kind of tenderness of envy of anyone who had been so happy as to have that opportunity
his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat
the state of mississippi seemed to him the state of despair so he surrendered the remnants of his patrimony to his mother and sisters and at nearly thirty years of age elided for the first time in new york in the costume of his province with fifty dollars in his pocket and a gnawing hunger in his heart
it was in the female line as basil ransom had written in answering her letter with a good deal of form and flourish he spoke as if they had been royal houses
if it had been possible to send mrs ransom money or even clothes she would have liked that but she had no means of ascertaining how such an offering would be taken
olive had a fear of everything but her greatest fear was of being afraid thank you for watching
she had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that whenever she saw a risk she was to take it and she had frequent humiliations at finding herself saved after all
she was perfectly safe after writing to basil ransom and indeed it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thank her he was only exceptionally superlative for her letter and assure her that he would come and see her the first time his business he was beginning to get a little should take him to boston
he was too simple too mississippian for that she was almost disappointed you
of all things in the world contention was most sweet to her though why it is hard to imagine for it always cost her tears headaches a day or two in bed acute emotion and it was very possible basil ransom would not care to contend
the gentleman had not even needed to sit down to become interested apparently he had taken up the volume from a table as soon as he came in and standing there after a single glance round the apartment had lost himself in its pages
that has an unflattering sound for me said the young man
she is willing to risk that
just as i am the visitor inquired presenting himself with rather a workaday aspect you
he was tall and lean and dressed throughout in black his shirt collar was low and wide and the triangle of linen a little crumpled exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat was adorned by a pin containing a small red stone
in spite of this decoration the young man looked poor as poor as a young man could look who had such a fine head and such magnificent eyes you
those of basil ransom were dark deep and glowing his head had a character of elevation which fairly added to his stature it was a head to be seen above the level of a crowd on some judicial bench or political platform or even on a bronze medal
these things the eyes especially with their smouldering fire might have indicated that he was to be a great american statesman or on the other hand they might simply have proved that he came from carolina or alabama
and yet the reader who likes a complete image who desires to read with the senses as well as with the reason is entreated not to forget that he prolonged his consonants and swallowed his vowels that he was guilty of allegiance and interpolations which were equally unexpected and that his discourse was pervaded by something sultry and vast something almost african in its rich basking tone something that suggested the teeming expanse of the cottonfield you

she stood there looking consciously and rather seriously at mr ransom a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lips it was just perceptible enough to light up the native gravity of her face
her voice was low and agreeable a cultivated voice and she extended a slender white hand to her visitor who remarked with some solemnity he felt a certain guilt of participation in mrs luna's indiscretion that he was intensely happy to make her acquaintance
he observed that miss chancelew's hand was at once cold and limp she merely placed it in his without exerting the smallest pressure you

they were her sisters they were her own and the day of their delivery had dawned you
this was the only sacred cause this was the great the just revelation it must triumph it must sweep everything before it it must exact from the other the brutal bloodstained ravening race the last particle of expiation
there would be names of women weak insulted persecuted but devoted in every pulse of their being to the cause and asking no better fate than to die for it
it was not clear to this interesting girl in what manner such a sacrifice as this last would be required of her that she solved the matter through a kind of sunrise mist of emotion which made danger as rosy a success
when miss bird's eye approached it transfigured her familiar her comical shape and made the poor little humanitary hack seem already a martyr and
olive chancellor looked at her with love remembered that she had never in her long and rewarded weary life had a thought or an impulse for herself herself

he has known her all her life and has a good influence over her thank you
now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that week for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided she missed the pleasant little interviews that used to put a certain flavor of romance into her dull hardworking days
i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that most attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected
it was that indescribable something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been blessed with wise and good mothers 
this had an especial charm to polly for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to everyone i did it
lately this had changed especially towards polly and it flattered her more than she would confess even to herself theme song
at first she tried to think she could but unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even gratitude
polly felt a very cordial friendship for mr sydney but not one particle of the love which is the only coin in which love can be truly paid you
this finished polly's indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with the spice of the old eve in her composition
when saturday came polly started as usual for a visit to becky and bess but couldn't resist stopping at the shores to leave a little parcel for fen though it was calling time
a foolish little speech to make to a dog but you see polly was only a tenderhearted girl trying to do her duty you
take hold of master charlie's hand miss mamie and walk pretty like willie and flossie said the maid you
at the street corner a blackeyed schoolboy was parting from a rosyfaced schoolgirl whose musicroll he was reluctantly surrendering we've closed upachelors around also said the guard you came from far away all of us honeybees were coming in from over there where they had fun so i looked for you you looked for us during ramadan too we view you with tikkon yes but you believe rain more than anything in your life and is it all here demanded his neighbor next chamberlain led the contents of the envier too altro
how he got there was never very clear to polly but there he was flushed and a little out of breath but looking so glad to see her till she had not the heart to be stiff and cool as she had fully intended to be when they met
she really could not help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely what's that thing • equity mentioned
that is the way i get to the ross answered polly that is the way i get to the ross
she did not mean to tell but his frankness was so agreeable she forgot herself
but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she tries to mend her thoughts though she won't own it and will surprise you someday by the amount of heart and sense and goodness she has got
thank you no
how lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
ask the art for young men laying a trap into which polly immediately fell the end
he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being both proud and generous resolved to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as well as his own he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being both proud and generous resolved to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as well as his own he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being both proud and generous resolved to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as well as his own
so when she made her last buoyant remark he said quietly watching her face keenly all the while i thought so well i'm going out of town on business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me annoyed well you didn't say i still remember the time
she thought she had a good deal of the coquette in her and i have no doubt that with time and training she would have become a very dangerous little person but now she was far too transparent and straightforward by nature even to tell a wildlike levelly you
he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and accepted it in silence
polly did not return to her favorite walk till she learned from minnie that the uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the way so pleasant after all
dramatic music working two and four as usual what's the news with you dramatic music
perhaps you chilled him you chilled him

now don't be affected polly but just tell me like a dear has not he proposed thank you
don't you think he means to
julie fan thank you
i don't mean to be prying but i really thought he did
well i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have
i just gave him a hint and he took it
he meant to go away before that so don't think his heart is broken or mind what silly tetler say
he understood and being a gentleman made no fuss the end
but polly it would have been a grand thing for you
i'm odd you know i prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days
never mind what the business was it suffices to say that it was a good beginning for a young man like tom who having been born and bred in the most conservative class of the most conceited city in new england needed just the healthy hearty social influences of the west to widen his views and make a man of him
fortunately everyone was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for romance of any sort and the four young people worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not bottled up in their respective hearts
pity that the end should come so soon but the hour did its work and went its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind though the young folks did not see it then for their eyes were dim because of the partings that must be
if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a summer in town but sydney often called till his vacation came and a voluminous correspondence with polly beguiled the long days
tom wrote once a week to his mother but the letters were short and not very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear you
now i'm only tired had a good deal to do lately and the dull weather makes me just a travel brew just are living in these little circumstances and the bus will come dest mcdammags cool p vega yunlar toothpaste blend which does no many people about my friend's base paint experience or nice looking skin color oraa scapula here  for those of you who don't even know арneischeée bhroomet this gel is what it has to last and can be tone changing and it's a great gel to use if you're space knots you're planning to support a scene of a life
forgive me polly but i can't help saying it food is there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can
i tried not to deceive myself but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me
thank heaven for that
guide polly with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice
poor polly was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say
none were needed her talty face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish ostrich and the henders are after it
once or twice but sort of jokingly and i thought it was only some little flirtation
it was so stupid of me not to guess before thank you
it was so tender earnest and defiant that fanny forgot the defence of her own love and admiration of polly's loyalty to hers for this faithful allabsorbing love was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friends boast of two or three lovers a year and calculate their respective values with almost as much coolness as the young men discussed the fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to marry the young man's love was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friends boast of two or three lovers a year and calculate their respective values with almost as much coolness as the young man discussed the fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to marry
i hope maria bailey is all he thinks of she added softly for i could not bear to have him disappointed again
i'm not going to let you go i promise said fanny turning hopeful all at once
suppose i say a word to tom just inquire after his heart in a general way you know and give him a chance to tell me if there's anything to tell you
bear it people always do bear things somehow answered polly looking as if sentence had been passed upon her you
it was a very different window from the last for both the girls
if fanny wanted to show him
she kept much at home when the day's work was done finding it pleasanter to sit dreaming of a book or sewing alone than to exert herself even to go to the shores
polly was not at all like herself that winter and those nearest to her saw and wondered at it most you
for ned was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole bailey question and left them in utter darkness
then he came walking in upon her one day looking as if she brought hidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them he came walking in upon her one day looking as if she brought hidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them
but if workbaskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any we read you
